This file documents known issues present in the Davenport application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE:
    "Access denied" errors occur when attempting to access Windows 2003
    servers.
DETAILS:
    When NTLM authentication is used, clients are unable to access Windows
    2003 servers.  Errors indicating denial of access or multiple login
    prompts are experienced.
STATUS:
    Workarounds available.  Windows 2003 requires SMB signing by default.
    To perform SMB signing, Davenport requires access to the user's password,
    which is not available under NTLM authentication.  This can be resolved
    in one of two ways:

    1) Disable SMB signing on the Windows 2003 server.  For more details, see:

        http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=811497

    2) Configure Davenport to use HTTP Basic authentication only.  This is
       done by editing Davenport's deployment descriptor ("web.xml"); set
       "enableNtlm" to "false", and "jcifs.http.enableBasic" to "true".  It
       is strongly recommended that HTTPS be used in this approach (as
       passwords will be send unencrypted across the network).

ISSUE:
    When switching from the HTML view of a collection to the Web Folders view
    under Windows Web Folders causes "ghost" folder to appear when the
    collection's filename contains non-ASCII characters.  Observed against
    Davenport 0.9.0.
DETAILS:
    When viewing a collection whose filename contains non-ASCII characters,
    reopening the collection as a Web Folder by clicking on the banner link
    results in a subfolder with the same name as the parent.  Attempting to
    open this "ghost" subfolder results in an error.
STATUS:
    Will not be fixed.  Internet Explorer accesses the collection correctly
    (using the UTF-8 representation for non-ASCII characters); however, when
    switching to Web Folders it uses the local character set to match the
    resource name.  It incorrectly identifies the collection as a member
    of itself.  Workaround is to navigate to the parent, and reopen the
    collection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE:
    Error occurs when using Windows' Web Folders to access files containing
    non-ASCII characters when Davenport is running under Caucho' Resin
    Servlet container (and possibly others).  Reported against Davenport 0.8.0.
DETAILS:
    Servlet containers which accept only UTF-8 characters within URLs will
    not accept requests from Windows' Web Folders which contain non-ASCII
    characters.  Web Folders encodes such characters using the local character
    set, rather than UTF-8.  Resin in particular is known to exhibit this
    behavior, which results in the following response header under that
    container:

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request The URL contains escaped bytes unsupported by the utf-8 encoding.

STATUS:
    Will not be fixed.  This issue is external to Davenport, and would require
    correction on the part of Windows or Resin.  Note that this is NOT
    technically a bug in Resin; there is no mandated interpretation of encoded
    non-ASCII URL characters, and UTF-8 is the recommended best practice.
    However, blocking the request at the container level prevents Davenport
    from receiving the request.  Web Folders' use of the local character set
    is non-portable, but is not likely to be corrected.  Note that this behavior
    is exhibited even when the Internet Explorer option "Always send URLs as
    UTF-8" is selected.
